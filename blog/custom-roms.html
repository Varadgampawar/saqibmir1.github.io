	<p>Andorid is an open source project and every andorid smartphone company uses their own skin/ui for their phones, for example redmi uses miui, samsung uses one ui and so on to make them look diffent from their competetors. These roms are calles stock roms.</p>

	<p>Some well known custom roms are pixel experience, lineage os, crdroid.</p>


	<h2>Why Use Custom Rom:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Devs deliberately push updates that slow down your phone after a year or two of release (It's a marketing strategy)</li>
