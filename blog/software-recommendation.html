<h1>Software Recommendations</h1>

<p class='date'>Sat, 28 May 2022</p>


	<p><b>Here's a detailed list of all free and open sourse softwares that i use and the ones i recommend.</b></p>
        <br>

<h2 class="blogsubheading">Software I Use</h2>

	<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
	<p>GNU/Linux ofcourse. I have used windows 10 and 11 in the past but only for the purpose of gaming. Other that i cant stand using a non unix based operating system. The distro that i use is <a href=https://www.archlinux.org>Arch Linux</a> because of its simplicity and KISS ( keep it simple, stupid!)   philosophy.</p>
	<p>As far a smart phones are conserned, i have an andorid device on which i use custom roms because most stock roms that come preinstalled  are bloated as hell and have a lot of telemetry enabled by default.</p>
	<p>I use <a href="https://lineageos.org">Lineage OS </a> with open gapps</p>




	<h2>Shell</h2>
	<p>I use zsh as my default shell because it supports a lot of plugins and has auto tab completion and syntax highlighting too. You can
	try my zsh configuration <a href="#https://github.com/saqibmir1/zoomershell">here</a></p>

	<h2>Text Editing</h2>
	<p>I use <a href="https://neovim.io">neovim</a> as my text editor. It is a terminal based vim like text editor with a little more features and plugins. Like vim, it doesn't require mouse and is completely keyboard centric.
	However, if you wish to use a gui based text editor, i would recommend gedit.</p>
	<p>P.S: I don't recommended using bloated IDE's. unless you are working on a huge android application project lol. </p>


	<h2>Window Manager</h2>
	<p>I use suckless <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org">DWM</a> (dynamic window manager)</p>
	<p>I also use other sucless tools like dmenu, st,  etc with dwm.</p>

	<h2>File Manager</h2>
	<p>I am using <a href="https://github.com/ranger/ranger">ranger</a> which is a terminal based file manager written in python.</p>



	<h2>Web Browser</h2>
	<p>My web browser of choice is <a href=www.mozilla.org> firefox</a> however i sometimes use <a href=#brave>brave</a> too because it is chromium based and it has access to all chrome store extensions.</p>

<h2 class="blogsubheading">Software I Don't Use</h2>

	<h2>IDE's</h2>
	<p>IDE's are bloated and are for soydevs. I try to keep my system as minimal as possible</p>

	<h2>GUI apps</h2>
	<p>Dont get me wrong. I do use a graphical server. I just prefer not to use a gui front end for a software if there is a cli tool already available for the sake of simplicity. That's the reason why i don't use a desktop environment anymore. The only gui software i have on my system right now is the web browser. Other than that, everything is either a cli tool/terminal based app or handeled by scripts.</p>
