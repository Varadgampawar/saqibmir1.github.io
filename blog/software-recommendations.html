<h1>Software Recommendations</h1>

<p class='date'>Wed, 11 Jun 2022</p>



	<p><b>Here's a detailed list of all free and open sourse softwares that i use and the ones i recommend.</b></p>
        <br>

	<h2>Operating Systems</h2>
	<p>GNU/Linux ofcourse. I have used windows 10 and 11 in the past but only for the purpose of gaming. Other that i cant stand using a non unix based operating system. The distro that i use is <a href=https://www.archlinux.org>Arch Linux</a> because of its simplicity and KISS( keep it simple, stupid!)  philosophy</p>
	<br>
	<p>As far a smart phones are conserned, i have an andorid device on which i use custom roms because most stock roms that come preinstalled  are bloated as hell and have a lot of telemetry enabled by default.</p>
	<p>I use <a href="#lineageos">Lineage OS </a> with open gapps</p>


	<h2>Shell</h2>
	<p>I use zsh as my default shell because it supports a lot of plugins and has auto tab completion and syntax highlighting too. You can
	try my zsh configuration <a href="#https://github.com/saqibmir1/zoomershell">here</a></p>

	<h2>Text Editing</h2>
	<p>I use <a href="#neovim">neovim</a> as my text editor. It is a terminal based vim like text editor with a little more features and plugins. Like vim, it doesn't require mouse and is completely keyboard centric.
	However, if you wish to use a gui based text editor, i would recommend gedit.</p>
	<p>P.S: I don't like to use bloated IDE's. unless you are working on a huge android application lol. </p>


	<h2>Window Manager/"DE"</h2>
	<p>I have used <a href=#dwm>DWM</a></p> in the past as my window manager. It is a suckless software written in C but currently i am
	using <a href=#KDE>KDE</a> which is a desktop environment which is heavily based on qt framework.

	<h2>Web Browser</h2>
	<p>My web browser of choice is <a href=#firefox> firefox</a> however i sometimes use <a href=#brave>brave</a> too because it is chromium based</p>


	<p><b>That's pretty much it for me.>
