<h1>Linux Elitism</h1>

<p class='date'>Wed, 11 Jun 2022</p>


	
	<p><i>In computer world,it is often said that a person who runs linux has an elitest attitude.
	Is there any reason behind that or is it just an ego driven  emotion to tell themselves
	that they are smarter than others. Well to me, that is not an attitude. Yes they are the
	elitest. Let's find out why:</i></p>
	
	<h2>They are not afraid to stray from herd:</h2>
	<p>The fact that Linux only has 2% of the desktop operating system market share
        alone make the linux users the elitest because they do not care what majority
        of the population uses.</p>

	<h2>They are real nerds:</h2>
	<p>Even if you compare a linux user to windoze power user, he probably knows more
        about his operating System that the windoze power user know about his. Even an
        average linux user is aware about things like what a kernel is, what DE, WM,
        init-system user-permissions are So yeah, linux users are much more tech
        savvy.</p>

	
	<h2>They are control freaks:</h2>
	<p> Linux users like to have full control over their system. From the color of their
        mouse cursor to write permissions for system core configs. A windoze and a mac user
        cannot say the same.
        A linux user knows where every nut and bolt of his operating systme lies and
        knows how to configure them.
        Fr tho? How many windoze users have you seen who keep track of their config
        files? Heck, Do windoze programs even have config files?
        Wait...!. Does a windoze user even know what a config file is?</p>
	
	<h2>They put in the work, put in the hour:</h2>
	<p> Switching to linux is a long journey. They distro-hop, they look for alternatives
        for the programs that they were used to on windoze. There are some linux
        (arch,gentoo, lfs) users that install/compile/configure their operating system
        from the scratch to run their elite distro.</p>


	<h2>They are passionate:</h2>
	<p> The thing about humans is once their basic basic needs are fullfilled, if they
        are getting food, chothes and shelter. They start loosing that drive for survival
        In modern times, this is so common. We all have smartphones, access to almost
        everything on out fingertips, We have access to netflix, porn, we can get food
        on our doorsteps. All these thing keep us preoccupied so that we are never going
        to set foot out of out comfort zone or go out and do things that are really
        dificult to do.
        <br>
        This is the reason why so many people say linux linux is difficult. True the
        learning curvature is steep but that is only because we all are so used to windoze
        like operating systems, any other os seems so foreign.
        It's the passion for technology that makes a person to ditch the "out of the
        box" tools and try out other alternatives and choose the one that fits best
        according to their needs.</p>

		<p><i>In conclusion: Suck my dick</i></p>


	<p><b>That's pretty much it. Thanks for reading.</b></p>
