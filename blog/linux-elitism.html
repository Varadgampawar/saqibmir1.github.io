<h1>Linux Elitism</h1>

<p class='date'>Wed, 11 Jun 2022</p>


	
	<p><b>In computer world,it is often said that a person who runs linux has an elitest attitude.
        Is there any reason behind that or is it just an ego driven  emotion to tell themselves
        that they are smarter than others. Well to me, that is not an attitude. Yes they are the
        elitest. What makes them the elitest? Let's find out:</b></p>
        <br>
	
	<h3>Herd Mentality:</h3>
	<p> The fact that Linux only has 2% of the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide">desktop operating system market share</a>
        alone make the linux users the elitest because they are not afraid to stray
        from herd.</p>
        <br>

	<h3>Real tech savvy:</h3>
	<p> Even if you compare a linux user to windoze power user, he probably knows more
        about his operating System that the windoze power user know about his. Even an
        average linux user is aware about things like what a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-the-linux-kernel">kernel</a> is, what DE, WM,
        init-system user-permissions because linux users are more tech literate.
        </p>
        <br>

	
	<h3>Control Freaks:</h3>
	<p> Linux users like to have full control over their system. From the color of their
        mouse cursor to tweaking the kernel. You cannot say the same for windoze and
        mac users.
        A linux user knows where every nut and bolt of his operating systme lies and
        knows how to configure them.
        How many windoze users have you seen who keep track of their config
        files? Heck, Do windoze users even know what a config file is?
        Wait!, Do windoze programs even have a config file?</p>
        <br>
	
	<h3>Tech enthuasisism:</h3>
	<p> I dont even know if i spelled the word correctly but who cares. My point is
        linux users are tech enthuasists.
        why most people switch to linux is because of its extinsibily due to its
        decentralized nature.
        There are some linux elite linux distros like <a href="https://www.gentoo.org">gentoo<a/>,
        <ahref="https://www.archlinux.org">arch</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org"> lfs </a>that need to be compiled/installed/configured from
        the scratch. It takes weeks or ever months for a beginner to make their own custom
        version of WMs for such distros. </p>
        <br>


	<h3>Apathy:</h3>
	<p> The thing about humans is once their basic basic needs are fullfilled, if they
        are getting food, chothes and shelter. They start loosing that drive for survival.
        I know that sounded totally out of context but the concept applies here too.
        In modern times, it is so common. We all have smartphones, access to almost
        everything on out fingertips. Netflix,tons of porn on sites, we
        can order food and get food on our doorsteps. All these thing keep us
        preoccupied so that we are never going
        to set foot out of out comfort zone or go out and do things that are really
        dificult to do.
        The reason why so many people say linux linux is difficult is not because
        linux is meant for high IQ people but because of apathy and lack of concern.
        Apathy is so common in modern
        in modern society that a normie can't really be bothered to care about these things
        . True the  learning curve is steep but that is only because
        we are so used to "comfy"/"out of the box" things that any other option, in this
        case, linux, seems  so foreign.
        It is the passion for technology that makes linux users far superior over
        others.</p>
